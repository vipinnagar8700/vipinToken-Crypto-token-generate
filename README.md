Good evening, Mr. Vipin Nagar! 👋
 Let’s get your ERC-20 “VipinToken” deployed successfully on Sepolia step by step.

🧱 Your Project Overview
You already have:
A working ERC-20 contract ✅

Hardhat project with dotenv configured ✅

Deployment script ✅

Dependencies in package.json ✅

We just need to fix a few things and run the correct commands.

⚙️ 1. Fix the .env file
Your .env file currently uses the mainnet URL, but you’re deploying to Sepolia testnet.
✅ Replace with this:
SEPOLIA_URL=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/146fd59911af4c8f91ef6604039921de
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=FFZKM77FHNHZ236RW8B91SQR3E536AI6NK
PRIVATE_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE
NEXT_PUBLIC_TOKEN_ADDRESS=

⚠️ Important:
 PRIVATE_KEY must be a real 64-character hex key starting with 0x, not a short one or one containing / or ..
 Example:
PRIVATE_KEY=0xabc12345d6e7890ffedc12345ab67890ffedc12345ab67890ffedc12345ab6789

You can export a private key from MetaMask → Account → Export Private Key.
 💡 Use a test wallet (not your main one).

🧩 2. Install dependencies
In your project root folder:
npm install


🚀 3. Compile the contract
npx hardhat compile

If it succeeds, you’ll see:
Compiled 1 Solidity file successfully


🔥 4. Deploy to Sepolia
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia

If everything is correct, you’ll see:
✅ VipinToken deployed to: 0xYourDeployedTokenAddress


✅ 5. (Optional) Verify on Etherscan
After deployment, run:
npx hardhat verify --network sepolia 0xYourDeployedTokenAddress "1000000"

This will verify your contract so it’s viewable on Sepolia Etherscan.

💰 6. Add Token to MetaMask
Open MetaMask → Sepolia Test Network

Click Import Tokens

Paste your contract address from step 4

You’ll see:

Token Name: VipinToken

Symbol: VPN

Decimals: 18

Click Add Token


🧾 7. Get Test ETH (Sepolia Faucet)

If you’d like, I can also help you migrate this ERC20 token to mainnet or integrate send/receive UI in your Next.js / React Native app.
Would you like me to show you how to send/receive your new token (VPN) in a web or mobile wallet UI next?
